# 🚀 Quick Start - Get FLPerformance Running

Follow these steps to get up and running in minutes!

## ✅ Step 1: Install Foundry Local (Required)

**Windows:**
```powershell
winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install foundry-local
```

**Verify it worked:**
```bash
foundry-local --version
```

✅ If you see a version number, you're good to go!

## ✅ Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure you're in the FLPerformance directory:

```powershell
# Check where you are
Get-Location

# Should show: C:\Users\...\FLPerformance
# If not, navigate to the project:
cd path\to\FLPerformance
```

Run the installation script:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

This will:

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Can't access http://localhost:3000?

**Check if servers are running:**
```powershell
# You should see both processes running in your terminal
# Frontend: Vite dev server on port 3000
# Backend: Express server on port 3001
```

**Restart if needed:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop
- Run `npm run dev` again

### "Foundry Local not found" error?

**Make sure it's installed:**
```bash
foundry-local --version
```

**If not found:**
- Windows: `winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal`
- macOS: `brew install foundry-local`
- Restart your terminal after installation

### Model won't load?

**Check disk space:**
- Models are ~2-50GB each
- Ensure you have enough free space

**Check internet:**
- First-time load requires download
- Check your network connection

### Port already in use?

**Something else using port 3000 or 3001:**

```powershell
# Find what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill the process (use PID from above)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```
